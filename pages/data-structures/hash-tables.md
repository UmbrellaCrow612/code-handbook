## Hash Tables

A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs. It provides constant-time average case operations, making it an essential data structure in many applications.

### Structure and Operations

A hash table consists of an array, often called a hash table or bucket array, and a hash function. The array is divided into a fixed number of slots or buckets, and each slot can store one key-value pair or multiple pairs using techniques like chaining or open addressing.

The key operations supported by hash tables are:

- **Insertion**: Adding a key-value pair to the hash table.
- **Deletion**: Removing a key-value pair from the hash table.
- **Lookup**: Retrieving the value associated with a given key.

To perform these operations efficiently, hash tables rely on the following concepts:

- **Hash Function**: A hash function takes a key as input and maps it to an index within the hash table. It ensures that keys are distributed uniformly across the available slots, minimizing collisions and enabling direct access to the corresponding slot.
- **Collision Resolution**: Collisions occur when two keys are mapped to the same index by the hash function. Hash tables employ various collision resolution strategies to handle collisions, such as chaining (using linked lists in each slot) or open addressing (probing adjacent slots), to store multiple key-value pairs in the same slot.

### Hash Table Implementation

The implementation of a hash table involves the following steps:

1. Choose an appropriate size for the hash table array, taking into account the expected number of key-value pairs and the desired load factor.
2. Design or select a hash function that produces a unique index for each key (or minimizes collisions) to ensure a uniform distribution of keys across the slots.
3. Handle collisions using a collision resolution strategy, such as chaining (using linked lists) or open addressing (probing adjacent slots), to store multiple key-value pairs in the same slot.
4. Define data structures to represent key-value pairs and buckets, such as nodes and linked lists for chaining, or additional probing methods for open addressing.
5. Implement the hash table operations (insertion, deletion, lookup) based on the chosen implementation approach, considering the collision resolution strategy.

### Common Use Cases

Hash tables find applications in various domains, including:

- **Caching**: Hash tables can be used for efficient caching of frequently accessed data, reducing the time complexity of repeated computations or

lookups.

- **Databases**: Hash tables provide fast indexing for database systems, enabling quick retrieval and updates of records based on keys.
- **Symbol Tables**: Hash tables are commonly used to implement symbol tables in programming languages, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval of identifiers, variables, and their associated values.
- **Hash-Based Algorithms**: Hash tables form the foundation for several hash-based algorithms, such as hash-based set and map implementations, which enable constant-time operations for membership testing, unique element storage, and key-value associations.

### Summary

Hash tables are powerful data structures that provide efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations for key-value pairs. They leverage a hash function and collision resolution strategies to ensure fast access and storage of data. By understanding hash tables and their underlying concepts, you can efficiently organize and retrieve data based on keys, making them a valuable tool for solving a wide range of problems, from caching and databases to symbol tables and hash-based algorithms.
