# List of Core Devops Concepts

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Remember, this is an extensive list, and not all concepts may be applicable to every Devops scenario. 
You can choose to focus on the concepts that are most relevant to your specific DevOps goals and projects.

<Steps>
### CI/CD

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integration of code changes into a shared repository with automated testing.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automated deployment of code changes passing tests to staging/production.

### Continuous Deployment

- **Continuous Deployment:** Automated deployment of code changes directly to production.

### Version Control Systems

- **Version Control:** Managing code changes and history using tools like Git.
- **Note**: In fundamentals we cover this.
