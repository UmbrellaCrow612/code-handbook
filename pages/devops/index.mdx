# List of Core Devops Concepts

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Remember, this is an extensive list, and not all concepts may be applicable to
  every Devops scenario. You can choose to focus on the concepts that are most
  relevant to your specific DevOps goals and projects.

<Steps>

### CI/CD and Deployment

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** This involves the seamless integration of code changes into a shared repository, accompanied by automated testing to ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Once code changes pass tests, they are automatically deployed to staging or production environments.

### Continuous Deployment and Automated Pipelines

- **Continuous Deployment:** This takes automation a step further by directly deploying code changes to the production environment.
- **Automated Deployment Pipelines:** These pipelines comprise multiple automated stages for building, testing, and deploying applications.

### Version Control and Code Management

- **Version Control:** Utilizing tools like Git to effectively manage code changes and maintain a detailed history of modifications.
- **Note:** A foundational concept covered in our initial learning stages.

### Infrastructure Automation: IaC and Monitoring

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Streamlining infrastructure management through code-based automation.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Overseeing the health of servers, networks, and databases for optimal performance.

### Containerization and Configuration Management

- **Containerization:** Bundling applications along with their dependencies in isolated containers for consistent deployment.
- **Configuration Management:** Automating the maintenance of uniform configurations across different environments.
- **Orchestration:** Employing tools like Kubernetes to effectively manage containerized applications.
- **Versioning and Release Management:** Skillfully handling diverse application versions and releases.

### Testing and Monitoring for Quality

- **Automated Testing:** Implementation of various automated testing methods to uphold software quality.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Constantly monitoring performance metrics and storing logs for detailed analysis.

### Microservices Architecture

- **Microservices:** Constructing applications using independently deployable services for enhanced flexibility.

### Integrating Security in DevOps

- **Security in DevOps:** Embedding security practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

</Steps>

Remember that staying current with new tools and practices is essential in the evolving field of DevOps.
