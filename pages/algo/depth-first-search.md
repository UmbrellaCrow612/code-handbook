Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used for traversing or searching in graphs. It explores vertices and their connected edges in a depthward motion, going as far as possible before backtracking. DFS can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs, and it has various applications in graph theory and problem-solving.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Depth-First Search algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: Start by selecting a starting vertex in the graph. If the graph is connected, any vertex can be chosen as the starting point.

2. **Visit and Mark**: Visit the chosen vertex and mark it as visited to keep track of the visited vertices. You can store the visited vertices in a separate data structure, such as an array or a set.

3. **Explore Neighbors**: From the current vertex, choose an unvisited neighbor (adjacent vertex) and recursively apply DFS to it. This step ensures that all connected vertices are visited before backtracking.

4. **Backtracking**: If there are no unvisited neighbors from the current vertex, backtrack to the previous vertex in the path and continue the exploration by selecting another unvisited neighbor.

5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-4 until all vertices in the graph have been visited. If there are multiple disconnected components in the graph, you may need to perform additional DFS iterations to visit all components.

By following these steps, DFS traverses the graph in a depthward manner, exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This behavior makes DFS particularly useful for tasks such as finding paths between vertices, detecting cycles in graphs, and exploring connected components.

To learn and implement Depth-First Search, you can follow these steps:

1. Understand the basics of graphs and their representations, such as adjacency lists or adjacency matrices. Familiarize yourself with the concept of vertices and edges, as well as the connectivity between them.

2. Implement the Depth-First Search algorithm in your preferred programming language. You will need to represent the graph, keep track of visited vertices, and recursively explore the neighbors.

3. Test your implementation with different graphs, including directed and undirected graphs with varying complexities. Verify that your DFS algorithm correctly visits all vertices and handles backtracking appropriately.

4. Consider edge cases, such as graphs with cycles or disconnected components, and ensure your implementation handles them correctly.

Learning materials for Depth-First Search can include textbooks, online tutorials, and programming resources. Here are some resources that can help you understand DFS in detail:
