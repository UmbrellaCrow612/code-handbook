The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It involves selecting a subset of items from a given set, considering their values and weights, in order to maximize the total value while respecting a constraint on the total weight.

The problem can be stated as follows: Given a set of items, each with a value and a weight, and a maximum weight capacity for a knapsack, determine the most valuable combination of items that can be packed into the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

The Knapsack Problem is often solved using dynamic programming due to its overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties. The dynamic programming approach allows for efficient computation of the optimal solution by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and reusing the solutions to these subproblems.

Here's a step-by-step overview of the dynamic programming algorithm for solving the Knapsack Problem:

1. **Define the problem**: Clearly understand the problem statement, including the values and weights of the items, the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack, and the goal of maximizing the total value.

2. **Formulate the recurrence relation**: Define a recurrence relation that represents the optimal solution to the Knapsack Problem in terms of its subproblems. This recurrence relation will be used to build up the solution iteratively.

3. **Create a memoization table**: Set up a memoization table, typically a two-dimensional array, to store the solutions to the subproblems. The table will have dimensions based on the number of items and the maximum weight capacity.

4. **Fill in the memoization table**: Iterate through the table, considering each item and each possible weight capacity. Use the recurrence relation to calculate the optimal value for each cell of the table based on the solutions to its subproblems. Fill in the table from smaller subproblems to larger ones.

5. **Trace back the optimal solution**: Once the memoization table is filled, trace back the table to determine which items were included in the optimal solution. Start from the last cell of the table and move towards the first cell, considering the choices made at each step based on the values in the table.

6. **Return the optimal solution**: The final result will be the combination of items that maximizes the total value while respecting the weight constraint. Return the selected items along with their corresponding values and weights.
