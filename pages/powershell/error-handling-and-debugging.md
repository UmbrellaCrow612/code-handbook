# Error Handling and Debugging in PowerShell

## Common Error Types in PowerShell

PowerShell can encounter various types of errors during script execution. Some common error types include:

1. **Terminating Errors**: These errors are severe and halt the script's execution. They are denoted by a red error message and typically indicate critical issues that prevent the script from continuing.

2. **Non-Terminating Errors**: These errors are less severe and do not halt the script's execution. They are denoted by a yellow warning message and often indicate issues that can be handled or ignored by the script.

3. **Exception Errors**: Exceptions are special types of errors that occur when something unexpected happens in the script. They can be caused by issues like invalid input, accessing non-existent resources, or unexpected behaviors.

## Using Try-Catch-Finally for Error Handling

PowerShell provides a powerful error handling mechanism using the `Try`, `Catch`, and `Finally` blocks. These blocks allow you to handle errors gracefully and take appropriate actions when exceptions occur.

### Try-Catch Block

The `Try` block encloses the code that may raise an exception. If an exception occurs within the `Try` block, PowerShell will immediately jump to the associated `Catch` block to handle the error.

```powershell
Try {
    # Code that may cause an exception
} Catch {
    # Code to handle the exception
}
```

### Finally Block

The `Finally` block (optional) is used to specify code that will always be executed, whether an exception occurs or not. This block is useful for cleanup tasks that should run regardless of whether an error occurred.

```powershell
Try {
    # Code that may cause an exception
} Catch {
    # Code to handle the exception
} Finally {
    # Code that always executes
}
```

### Example

```powershell
Try {
    $result = 10 / 0  # This will cause a division by zero exception
} Catch {
    Write-Host "An error occurred: $_"  # $_ contains the exception object
} Finally {
    Write-Host "Cleanup tasks (if any) go here."
}
```

## Utilizing Debugging Tools and Techniques

PowerShell provides various debugging tools and techniques to help identify and resolve issues in scripts. Some useful debugging tools include:

- `Write-Debug`: This cmdlet writes debugging information to the console when the script runs with the `-Debug` parameter.

- `Set-PSDebug`: This cmdlet sets the debugging options for the current session, allowing you to enable or disable debugging.

- `Debugging Breakpoints`: You can set breakpoints in your script to pause its execution at specific points. This allows you to inspect variables and step through the code line-by-line.

- `PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)`: The PowerShell ISE provides a graphical debugging interface with breakpoints, step over, step into, and step out functionality.

- `Visual Studio Code (VS Code)`: The VS Code editor also provides excellent debugging support for PowerShell scripts with breakpoints, variable inspection, and more.

### Example using Breakpoints

```powershell
# Set a breakpoint at a specific line in the script
Set-PSBreakpoint -Script .\MyScript.ps1 -Line 10

# Run the script with debugging
.\MyScript.ps1 -Debug
```

When the script execution reaches line 10, it will pause, and you can inspect variables and step through the code.

Using proper error handling and debugging techniques is essential for building robust and reliable PowerShell scripts. By understanding and effectively utilizing Try-Catch-Finally blocks, debugging tools, and techniques, you can identify and address errors in your scripts, ensuring they function as intended and handle exceptions gracefully.
