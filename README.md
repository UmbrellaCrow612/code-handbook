# Run locally

- Have `pnpm` package manager
- Have `Node` runtime installed
- Open code `dir` in editor
- Open `Terminal` and run:

```pnpm
pnpm i
```

- The run:

```pnpm
pnpm dev
```

- Open up localhost to see website

# Issues and resolutions

Deploying on vercel:

- Deploy normally however set a environment variable

```
VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1
```

Changing folder / file names:

- When you create a file make sure to have the stander:

- No caps lock an space is `-`

```
file-name
```

# Todo

data structures:

new form for learning materials:

- Intro
- Types of the data structure with diagrams
- Basic Operations that can be performed on the data structure
- Implementation how to build the data structure
- Usage, using the data structure and its operations
- Advantages
- Disadvantages
- Time and space complexity
- Use cases
- comparison with other data structures
- summary

redone:

- Array: new format from above.
- Stack: new format from above.
- linked list: done with format.
- Queue: done with format.
- Hash: done with format.
- graphs: done with format.
- Heap: done with format.
- Trie: done with format.


- Sit down and listen / read each chapter per day or two and see if anything is missing or if there is something that needs to be added

Done:

- Fundamentals: name checked, ordered them, renamed folder
- Fundamentals: rewrite with new format.

Fact check each file and make sure they are consistent
