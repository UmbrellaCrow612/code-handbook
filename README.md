# Run locally

- Have `pnpm` package manager
- Have `Node` runtime installed
- Open code `dir` in editor
- Open `Terminal` and run:

```pnpm
pnpm i
```

- The run:

```pnpm
pnpm dev
```

- Open up localhost to see website

# Issues and resolutions

Deploying on vercel:

- Deploy normally however set a environment variable

```
VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1
```

Changing folder / file names:

- When you create a file make sure to have the stander:

- No caps lock an space is `-`

```
file-name
```

# Todo

rewrite all learning materials using the new format promt below

Done:

- Fundamentals: name checked, ordered them, renamed folder - fundamentals - data structures.
- Fundamentals: rewrite with new format.
- Data Structures: rewrite with new format.
- Data Structures: markdown is correct order `# ##`
- Renamed all questions and answers to use number points.
- Algorithms: added algorithms and in format.

Later to do:

- Sit done and listen / proof read all of it.
- Add SEO, og images and descriptions like next.site or use there api to make your own

Fact check each file and make sure they are consistent

## Chat GPT prompt used to make http material (Good standers to be used)

a comprehensive learning material guide for `HTTP ` = subject or `make me a step-by-step learning guide for variables and data types in programming:`

- Then prompt by saying explain `point one`
- Continue above until all points from guide have been met.

```
Sure! Here's a comprehensive learning material guide for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
