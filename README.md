# Run locally

- Have `pnpm` package manager
- Have `Node` runtime installed
- Open code `dir` in editor
- Open `Terminal` and run:

```pnpm
pnpm i
```

- The run:

```pnpm
pnpm dev
```

- Open up localhost to see website

# Issues and resolutions

Deploying on vercel:

- Deploy normally however set a environment variable

```
VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1
```

Changing folder / file names:

- When you create a file make sure to have the stander:

- No caps lock an space is `-`

```
file-name
```

# Todo

- Fundamentals:

- Rename / change the questions and answers to use number bullet points.



Done:

- Fundamentals: name checked, ordered them, renamed folder - fundamentals - data structures.
- Fundamentals: rewrite with new format.
- Data Structures: rewrite with new format.
- Data Structures: markdown is correct order `# ##`

Later to do:

Sit done and listen / proof read all of it.

Fact check each file and make sure they are consistent
